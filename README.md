# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) - Project

## 🚚 Project Overview
This project provides a solution to the *Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)* by optimizing delivery routes for a fleet of trucks handling multiple orders. It combines clustering and metaheuristic optimization techniques to minimize total distance and operational costs.

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn (for KMeans)
- Custom ACO implementation
- LabelEncoder
  ## How to run the code
  -download the large_data.csv and distance.csv files from kaggle link
  -make sure you downoladed the needed libraries and dependiences
  -run the main.py file
  ## 📁 Output
The final results are saved in a text file and include:
- Truck assignments
- Optimized delivery routes
- Total travel distance per truck
- Total cost (distance + truck penalties)
